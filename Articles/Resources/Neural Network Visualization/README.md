# Top Tools for Designing and Visualizing Neural Network Architectures

Welcome to the ultimate compilation of tools that will enhance your experience in designing and visualizing neural network architectures. Whether you're a seasoned AI practitioner or just getting started, these tools are here to simplify and enrich your workflow.

1. [Net2Vis](https://viscom.net2vis.uni-ulm.de/OG1Br2BAkYSwwrV6CADl4X5EfErFjUzvuUwXWDdLbdsIXNhb9L): Net2Vis automatically generates abstract visualizations for convolutional neural networks from Keras code.
2. [Visualkeras](https://github.com/paulgavrikov/visualkeras/) : Visualkeras is a Python package to help visualize Keras (either standalone or included in tensorflow) neural network architectures. It allows easy styling to fit most needs. As of now it supports layered style architecture generation which is great for CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) and a grap style architecture.

```python
import visualkeras

model = ...

visualkeras.layered_view(model).show() # display using your system viewer
visualkeras.layered_view(model, to_file='output.png') # write to disk
visualkeras.layered_view(model, to_file='output.png').show() # write and show

visualkeras.layered_view(model)
```
3. [draw_convnet](https://github.com/gwding/draw_convnet) : Python script for illustrating Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet)

4. [NNSVG](https://alexlenail.me/NN-SVG/LeNet.html):Publication-ready NN-architecture schematics.

5. [PlotNeuralNet](https://github.com/HarisIqbal88/PlotNeuralNet) : Latex code for drawing neural networks for reports and presentation. Have a look into examples to see how they are made. Additionally, lets consolidate any improvements that you make and fix any bugs to help more people with this code.

6. [Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/graphs): TensorBoardâ€™s Graphs dashboard is a powerful tool for examining your TensorFlow model.

7. [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/tree/master): In Caffe you can use [caffe/draw.py](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/python/caffe/draw.py) to draw the NetParameter protobuffer:
