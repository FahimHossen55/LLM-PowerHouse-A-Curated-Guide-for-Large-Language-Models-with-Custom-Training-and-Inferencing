# What I am learning

After immersing myself in the recent GenAI text-based language model hype for nearly a month, I have made several observations about its performance on my specific tasks.

Please note that these observations are subjective and specific to my own experiences, and your conclusions may differ.

- We need a minimum of 7B parameter models (<7B) for optimal natural language understanding performance. Models with fewer parameters result in a significant decrease in performance. However, using models with more than 7 billion parameters requires a GPU with greater than 24GB VRAM (>24GB).
- Benchmarks can be tricky as different LLMs perform better or worse depending on the task. It is crucial to find the model that works best for your specific use case. In my experience, MPT-7B is still the superior choice compared to Falcon-7B.
- Prompts change with each model iteration. Therefore, multiple reworks are necessary to adapt to these changes. While there are potential solutions, their effectiveness is still being evaluated.
- For fine-tuning, you need at least one GPU with greater than 24GB VRAM (>24GB). A GPU with 32GB or 40GB VRAM is recommended.
- Fine-tuning only the last few layers to speed up LLM training/finetuning may not yield satisfactory results. I have tried this approach, but it didn't work well.
- Loading 8-bit or 4-bit models can save VRAM. For a 7B model, instead of requiring 16GB, it takes approximately 10GB or less than 6GB, respectively. However, this reduction in VRAM usage comes at the cost of significantly decreased inference speed. It may also result in lower performance in text understanding tasks.
- Those who are exploring LLM applications for their companies should be aware of licensing considerations. Training a model with another model as a reference and requiring original weights is not advisable for commercial settings.
- There are three major types of LLMs: basic (like GPT-2/3), chat-enabled, and instruction-enabled. Most of the time, basic models are not usable as they are and require fine-tuning. Chat versions tend to be the best, but they are often not open-source.
- Not every problem needs to be solved with LLMs. Avoid forcing a solution around LLMs. Similar to the situation with deep reinforcement learning in the past, it is important to find the most appropriate approach.
- I have tried but didn't use langchains and vector-dbs. I never needed them. Simple Python, embeddings, and efficient dot product operations worked well for me.
- LLMs do not need to have complete world knowledge. Humans also don't possess comprehensive knowledge but can adapt. LLMs only need to know how to utilize the available knowledge. It might be possible to create smaller models by separating the knowledge component.
- The next wave of innovation might involve simulating "thoughts" before answering, rather than simply predicting one word after another. This approach could lead to significant advancements.
- The overparameterization of LLMs presents a significant challenge: they tend to memorize extensive amounts of training data. This becomes particularly problematic in RAG scenarios when the context conflicts with this "implicit" knowledge. However, the situation escalates further when the context itself contains contradictory information. A recent survey paper comprehensively analyzes these "knowledge conflicts" in LLMs, categorizing them into three distinct types:
    - Context-Memory Conflicts: Arise when external context contradicts the LLM's internal knowledge.
        - Solution
            - Fine-tune on counterfactual contexts to prioritize external information.
            - Utilize specialized prompts to reinforce adherence to context
            - Apply decoding techniques to amplify context probabilities.
            - Pre-train on diverse contexts across documents.

    - Inter-Context Conflicts: Contradictions between multiple external sources.
        - Solution:
            - Employ specialized models for contradiction detection.
            - Utilize fact-checking frameworks integrated with external tools.
            - Fine-tune discriminators to identify reliable sources.
            - Aggregate high-confidence answers from augmented queries.
    - Intra-Memory Conflicts: The LLM gives inconsistent outputs for similar inputs due to conflicting internal knowledge.
        - Solution:
            - Fine-tune with consistency loss functions.
            - Implement plug-in methods, retraining on word definitions.
            - Ensemble one model's outputs with another's coherence scoring.
            - Apply contrastive decoding, focusing on truthful layers/heads.
